            <span>Chhota Bheem and the Great Ladoo Challenge</span>
        </h2>
        <p align="center">In the cheerful village of Dholakpur, everyone loved one boy more than anything—Chhota Bheem.
            He was brave,
            kind, and super strong… especially after eating his favorite laddoos 😋.

            But not everyone was happy about Bheem’s popularity.

            Kalia, who was big, proud, and a little jealous, always wanted to prove that he was stronger than Bheem. One
            sunny morning, Kalia stood in the middle of the village and shouted,
            “Bheem! Today I will show everyone who is the strongest in Dholakpur!”</p>
        <p align="==justyfy">The villagers gathered. Raja Indravarma announced a challenge:
            “Whoever can lift the Royal Stone will be declared the strongest.”

            Kalia went first. He grunted, pushed, and pulled—but the stone didn’t move even an inch. He fell down with a
            thud! 😤

            Then Bheem smiled politely, ate a ladoo, and walked forward. With one strong push—WHOOSH!—the stone lifted
            into the air! Everyone clapped and cheered 🎉

            Kalia felt embarrassed, but Bheem helped him up and said,
            “Strength is good, Kalia, but kindness is more important.”

            Kalia learned his lesson that day. From then on, instead of fighting Bheem, he tried to be a better friend.

            And once again, peace and happiness returned to Dholakpur 🏰✨</p>
